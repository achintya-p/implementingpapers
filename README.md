# Paper Implementations

This repository contains my implementations of various research papers in machine learning and AI.

## Implemented Papers

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for large language models
- **DQN (Deep Q-Network)** - Deep reinforcement learning for Atari games
- **Transformer Architecture** - Implementation from scratch

Each implementation includes detailed code, documentation, and examples demonstrating the key concepts from the original papers.
